For this project, I wanted to get some experience with Django. I created two different applications, one was a projects application that would display all of the project items stored in a db to the user and then allow the user to go to the specific projects web pages and read about the specifics of them. The second was a fully functioning blog. For the blog, I utilized the django admin functionality to make the functionality of the blog such that I could utilize django admin to then write specfic categories and blog posts to the databases. I then created an index page that would display all of the blog posts that the admin(me) had written to the database. Additionally, the user could select a specific categories of posts that they were interested in and be displayed with all the blogs that were written on that specific category. Finally, I created a view for a specific post that which I also created a form with which a user could comment on a particular post. For specifics about the models that were used, refer to the models.py files in the associated projects.
